# Domain Model

## [domain.assessment-pipeline]
- **Aliases**: scoring, lumens, publish, grade, world-update
- **Short**: The pipeline from score entry to world state update.
- **Card**:
  1. TA enters scores → Assessment records created as `draft`
  2. TA previews: Lumen impact + landmark stage change preview
  3. TA publishes → atomic transaction:
     a. Assessment: draft → published
     b. LumenDelta computed per student (score% × mission max_lumens)
     c. ClassProgress.total_lumens updated
     d. LandmarkState.stage advanced if threshold crossed
     e. ShipLog entry created (bilingual narrative)
  4. ISR revalidation: harbor map, student dashboards
  Revision: new_score − old_score delta applied; audit trail kept.

## [domain.world-progression]
- **Aliases**: landmark, harbor, restoration, stage, milestone
- **Short**: Eight landmarks with configurable Lumen thresholds driving automatic stage advancement.
- **Card**:
  Thresholds configured per Course (staff-editable).
  Stages: 0=dormant, 1=under_restoration, 2=operational, 3=flourishing.
  Three distinct progress dimensions — never conflate:

    - Keeper Ranks: individual advancement (personal Lumens)
  Rank ladder: Apprentice → Beacon → Signal → Drift Navigator → Harbor Steward.

## [domain.auth]
- **Aliases**: auth, login, invite, registration, role

  Extensible: GitHub OAuth or UT SSO can be added as Auth.js providers later.
  Session: JWT. No server-side session storage required for Phase 1.
